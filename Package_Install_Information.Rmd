```
## Installing the sdm package

Please start by downloading the sdm package:
```{r, eval=FALSE}

install.packages('sdm')

```

Several other packages will also need to be installed (for model fitting
and evaluation). There is a function in the sdm package that will
install all of them at once for you:

```{r, message=FALSE}

library(sdm)

installAll()

```

If you are running into issues installing the package, it may be because
some of the packages require R to be updated to at least version 4.0.2.
If you get this error, update R and restart R Studio.

Please make sure that installAll() successfully installs all of the
packages without throwing any errors. If all of the associated packages
arenâ€™t downloaded, you will only be able to get through part of the
exercise.
